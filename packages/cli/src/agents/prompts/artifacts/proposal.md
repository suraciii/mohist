# Proposal Artifact

Create the proposal document that establishes WHY this change is needed.

## Sections

- **Why**: 1-2 sentences on the problem or opportunity. What problem does this solve? Why now?
- **What Changes**: Bullet list of changes. Be specific about new capabilities, modifications, or removals. Mark breaking changes with **BREAKING**.
- **Capabilities**: Identify which specs will be created or modified:
  - **New Capabilities**: List capabilities being introduced. Each becomes a new `specs/<name>/spec.md`. Use kebab-case names (e.g., `user-auth`, `data-export`).
  - **Modified Capabilities**: List existing capabilities whose REQUIREMENTS are changing. Only include if spec-level behavior changes (not just implementation details). Each needs a delta spec file. Check `openspec/specs/` for existing spec names. Leave empty if no requirement changes.
- **Impact**: Affected code, APIs, dependencies, or systems.

## Guidelines

The Capabilities section is critical. It creates the contract between proposal and specs phases. Research existing specs before filling this in. Each capability listed here will need a corresponding spec file.

Keep it concise (1-2 pages). Focus on the "why" not the "how" — implementation details belong in design.md.

This is the foundation — specs, design, and tasks all build on this.

**IMPORTANT**: Project context and rules from the prompt are constraints for you. Do NOT copy them into the output file.

## Output

Write the file to `{changeDir}/proposal.md`.
