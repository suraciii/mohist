## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Review APIs expose merge-base comparison data

`GET /api/issues/:number/diff`, `GET /api/issues/:number/commits`, and `GET /api/issues/:number/commits/:hash/diff` SHALL return availability-aware review payloads for the issue's pending merge content. Issue-level review data SHALL be framed around the current merge relationship between base and head, and issue-level diff data SHALL represent the merge-base-to-head change set rather than a generic two-dot base-vs-head comparison.

#### Scenario: Diff API returns merge-base comparison

- **WHEN** `GET /api/issues/:number/diff` is called for an issue with an existing worktree and accessible base/head branches
- **THEN** the response includes `available: true` and `reason: null`
- **AND** includes `base`, `head`, `mergeBase`, `ahead`, `behind`, `canFastForward`, and `comparison`
- **AND** `comparison` is `merge-base`
- **AND** the summary, file list, and per-file patch content are equivalent to `git diff <base>...<head>`

#### Scenario: Behind-base branch excludes base-only changes

- **WHEN** the issue branch is behind the base branch
- **THEN** `GET /api/issues/:number/diff` does not report files changed only on base
- **AND** the returned file count matches the issue's pending merge contribution from the merge base

#### Scenario: Commits API shares comparison metadata

- **WHEN** `GET /api/issues/:number/commits` is called for an issue with an existing worktree and accessible base/head branches
- **THEN** the response includes the same `base`, `head`, `mergeBase`, `ahead`, `behind`, `canFastForward`, and `comparison` metadata as the diff response
- **AND** returns the complete commit range that is reachable from head and not from base
- **AND** its summary counts are consistent with the issue-level diff response

#### Scenario: Commit diff remains commit-scoped

- **WHEN** `GET /api/issues/:number/commits/:hash/diff` is called for a commit that belongs to the issue branch
- **THEN** the response remains a single-commit diff payload
- **AND** it does not redefine the default issue-level Files changed semantic away from merge-base comparison

#### Scenario: Review data unavailable by lifecycle

- **WHEN** review data is unavailable because the worktree is removed, the issue has not started, a branch is missing, or git fails
- **THEN** the response data includes `available: false`
- **AND** `reason` is one of `worktree_removed`, `not_started`, `branch_missing`, or `git_error`
- **AND** `message` explains the cause for display in the UI
