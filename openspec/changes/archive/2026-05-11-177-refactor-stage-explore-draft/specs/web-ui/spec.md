## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: pipeline UI shows the backlog-first stage model (REQ-001)
The Web UI SHALL render the same pipeline stage model used by the backend.

#### Scenario: Pipeline views do not show deprecated stages
- **WHEN** the user views issue cards, pipeline timelines, or other stage-order UI
- **THEN** the UI shows `backlog -> plan -> build -> check -> integrate -> done`
- **AND** it does not render `draft` or `explore` as pipeline stages

### Requirement: Explore remains available outside the pipeline model (REQ-002)
The Web UI SHALL preserve Explore-specific capabilities without representing Explore as a pipeline stage.

#### Scenario: Explore surfaces still work
- **WHEN** the user opens Explore pages, sessions, or related API-driven views
- **THEN** those surfaces continue to function
- **AND** they do not depend on `Stage.Explore` being a legal pipeline stage
